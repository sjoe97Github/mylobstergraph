introduce Perceus, an algorithm for precise reference counting with reuse and specialization. Starting from a functional core language with explicit control-flow, Perceus emits precise reference counting instructions such that (cycle-free) programs are garbage free, where only live references are retained. This enables further optimizations, like reuse analysis that allows for guaranteed in-place updates at runtime. This in turn enables a novel programming paradigm that we call functional but in-place (FBIP). Much like tail-call optimization enables writing loops with regular function calls, reuse analysis enables writing in-place mutating algorithms in a purely functional way. We give a novel formalization of reference counting in a linear resource calculus, and prove that Perceus is sound and garbage free. We show evidence that Perceus, as implemented in Koka, has good performance and is competitive with other state-of-the-art memory collectors.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/qmtiul/perceus_garbage_free_reference_counting","submitter_user":{"username":"dbremner","created_at":"2012-09-06T19:01:18.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"C, C++, C#, and recently Python, Swift, and Objective-C.  \r\nLearning Scala.","is_moderator":false,"karma":2277,"avatar_url":"/avatars/dbremner-100.png","invited_by_user":"pushcx","github_username":"dbremner"},"tags":["pdf","programming"]},{"short_id":"icdz3a","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/icdz3a","created_at":"2021-09-20T11:30:39.000-05:00","title":"Core Image Tutorial for iOS: Custom Filters","url":"https://www.raywenderlich.com/25658084-core-image-tutorial-for-ios-custom-filters","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/icdz3a/core_image_tutorial_for_ios_custom","submitter_user":{"username":"napkindrawing","created_at":"2014-05-14T10:03:04.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Dad.

We also show that students can do quite well at PBT for these problems, suggesting that the topic is well within their reach. In the process, we introduce a simple method to evaluate the accuracy of their specifications, and use it to characterize their common mistakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eImportance\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBased on our findings, we believe that relational problems are an underutilized motivating example for PBT. We hope this paper initiates a catalog of such problems for educators (and developers) to use, and also provides a concrete (though by no means exclusive) method to analyze the quality of PBT.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/zlnp4x/using_relational_problems_teach","submitter_user":{"username":"dbremner","created_at":"2012-09-06T19:01:18.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"C, C++, C#, and recently Python, Swift, and Objective-C.  \r\nLearning Scala.","is_moderator":false,"karma":2277,"avatar_url":"/avatars/dbremner-100.png","invited_by_user":"pushcx","github_username":"dbremner"},"tags":["education","pdf","programming","testing"]},{"short_id":"avzpk2","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/avzpk2","created_at":"2021-09-20T07:57:44.000-05:00","title":"Monitoring for process completion in 2021","url":"https://ariadne.space/2021/09/20/monitoring-for-process-completion-in-2021/","score":5,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/avzpk2/monitoring_for_process_completion_2021","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.","is_moderator":false,"karma":83556,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["linux","unix"]},{"short_id":"ayhxfn","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ayhxfn","created_at":"2021-09-20T07:52:40.000-05:00","title":"Google Docs in a clean-room browser","url":"https://www.ekioh.com/devblog/google-docs-in-a-clean-room-browser/","score":34,"flags":1,"comment_count":3,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ayhxfn/google_docs_clean_room_browser","submitter_user":{"username":"freddyb","created_at":"2017-02-02T09:12:16.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Security.
