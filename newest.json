I know I‚Äôm not in danger of anything and I know I worry for stupid stuff, I just want to know your answer, not whether I‚Äôm right or not. And I thank you in advance for your answer. You take time to write the answer I appreciate it a lot. Thank you very much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the question. My blog is being published under a .com tld. Now you surely know how United States government has power over all com and net tlds (among other ones of course).\u003ca href=\"https://www.wired.com/2012/03/feds-seize-foreign-sites/\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003e1\u003c/a\u003e and I have a problem with that. As an Iranian, I‚Äôve seen many domain names of my fellow Iranians being seized for reasons like spreading misinformation or simply being Iranian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, Iranian Bank Saman‚Äôs sb24.com domain was seized (or taken away) because of sanctions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI‚Äôm paranoid and I worry for stupid stuff. I know I‚Äôm not in danger of anything but I just don‚Äôt like the fact that United States government can seize my domain name just because. Now, I was thinking about switching to .org (from my current .com) but well the authority behind .org is American as well. However, they don‚Äôt have a history of seizing domain names.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould I change my .com to .org? Now that doesn‚Äôt really change the fact that US can easily seize the domain but should I do it? Will it make it harder?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere‚Äôs also ccTLDs like .se or .ch or .no. For example, Pirate Bay domains were seized and they switched to .se. Even with them in jail, their .se domain is still active so I think switching to .se (or similar ccTLDs) makes sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also can switch to .ir (ccTLD for Iran) but you know how authoritative regimes act. I don‚Äôt want to jump from one problematic country to another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow my question is that if you were to start a blog, what domain extension would you choose, if you had to consider what I said as well as other factors.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/pcvqhl/what_domain_would_you_choose_for_your","submitter_user":{"username":"arh","created_at":"2020-03-27T16:00:24.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Free culture activist and privacy advocate.","is_moderator":false,"karma":394,"avatar_url":"/avatars/arh-100.png","invited_by_user":"conroy"},"tags":["ask","web"]},{"short_id":"5gqvpw","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/5gqvpw","created_at":"2021-09-07T10:01:33.000-05:00","title":"Rectangle{} debugging in QML, just like printf(), but for QT","url":"https://raymii.org/s/articles/Rectangle_debugging_in_QML_just_like_printf.html","score":6,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/5gqvpw/rectangle_debugging_qml_just_like_printf","submitter_user":{"username":"raymii","created_at":"2013-11-20T11:58:43.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"üêã\r\nhttps://raymii.org","is_moderator":false,"karma":12085,"avatar_url":"/avatars/raymii-100.png","invited_by_user":"journeysquid"},"tags":["c++","debugging","design"]},{"short_id":"x8pvb9","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/x8pvb9","created_at":"2021-09-07T09:44:52.000-05:00","title":"Building an ECS in TypeScript: An ECS in 99 Lines of Code","url":"https://maxwellforbes.com/posts/typescript-ecs-implementation","score":6,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/x8pvb9/building_ecs_typescript_ecs_99_lines_code","submitter_user":{"username":"bcongdon","created_at":"2019-12-27T13:23:21.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":1300,"avatar_url":"/avatars/bcongdon-100.png","invited_by_user":"gerikson","github_username":"bcongdon"},"tags":["games","javascript"]},{"short_id":"grnpkf","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/grnpkf","created_at":"2021-09-07T09:40:47.000-05:00","title":"Writing software in Rust that's reliable enough for production","url":"https://pythonspeed.com/fil/docs/fil4prod/reliable.html","score":16,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/grnpkf/writing_software_rust_s_reliable_enough","submitter_user":{"username":"itamarst","created_at":"2016-04-28T10:05:47.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Writing about Python performance and faster development at https://pythonspeed.com, as well as offering consulting services.
