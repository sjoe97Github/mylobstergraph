In contrast to LuaJIT it supports static typing on bytecode level and a corresponding speed-up. I did measurements with the Are-we-fast-yet benchmark suite and found a speedup factor 2.5 on Linux compared to LuaJIT (see \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/rochus-keller/Oberon/blob/master/testcases/Are-we-fast-yet/Are-we-fast-yet_results_linux.pdf\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ehttps://github.com/rochus-keller/Oberon/blob/master/testcases/Are-we-fast-yet/Are-we-fast-yet_results_linux.pdf\u003c/a\u003e for more information). Mono is still sufficiently fast compared to the new CoreCLR engine from Microsoft; I did measurements with different versions of Mono and CoreCLR and found performance differences to be within 30% (see \u003ca href=\"https://www.quora.com/Is-the-Mono-CLR-really-slower-than-CoreCLR/answer/Rochus-Keller\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ehttps://www.quora.com/Is-the-Mono-CLR-really-slower-than-CoreCLR/answer/Rochus-Keller\u003c/a\u003e for more information).
